## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - TDD
  - Mocha
  - Chai

## Features
- Asks user a question
- Provides multiple options to choose as an answer
- Calculates total correct via percentage upon game completion.

## Deployed Page

## Possible Future Extensions
  - A login page would be super cool, if it were responsive in a sense of allowing users login to be saved/recipe ideas they like to be stored within their page.
  - Adding in transitions via CSS would have appreciated.

1. Fork this repo  
2. Clone the repo to your local machine
3. Run npm install inside the directory
4. Run node index.js to start the game
